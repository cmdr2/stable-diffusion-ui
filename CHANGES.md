# What's new?

## v2.4
### Major Changes
- **Support for custom VAE models**. You can place your VAE files in the `models/vae` folder, and refresh the browser page to use them. More info: https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui/wiki/VAE-Variational-Auto-Encoder
- **Experimental support for multiple GPUs!** It should work automatically. Just open one browser tab per GPU, and spread your tasks across your GPUs. For e.g. open our UI in two browser tabs if you have two GPUs. You can customize which GPUs it should use in the "Settings" tab, otherwise let it automatically pick the best GPUs. Thanks @madrang .

- **Cleaner UI design** - Show settings and help in new tabs, instead of dropdown popups (which were buggy). Thanks @mdiller
- **Progress bar.** Thanks @mdiller
- **Custom Image Modifiers** - You can now save your custom image modifiers! Your saved modifiers can include special characters like `{}, (), [], |`
- Drag and Drop **text files generated from previously saved images**, and copy settings to clipboard. Thanks @madrang
- Paste settings from clipboard. Thanks @JeLuf
- Bug fixes to reduce the chances of tasks crashing during long multi-hour runs (chrome can put long-running background tabs to sleep). Thanks @JeLuf and @madrang
- **Improved documentation.** Thanks @JeLuf and @jsuelwald
- Improved the codebase for dealing with system settings and UI settings. Thanks @mdiller
- Help instructions next to some setttings, and in the tab
- Show system info in the settings tab
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Enter to start a task
- Configuration to prevent the browser from opening on startup
- Lots of minor bug fixes
- A `What's New?` tab in the UI
