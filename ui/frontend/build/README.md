# stable-diffusion-ui - react codebase

> Not a developer? This readme is not for you. Check the docs on Github.

Most of the UI exists in index.html, however some has been moved to React.

To develop on the UI, run `npm install` from this folder to install dependencies, then `npm run dev`.

Then start up the stable-diffusion-ui server like normal, but browse to `localhost:9001` to get the development environment.

When you are ready, run `npm run build` to get a production build of the frontend code build and copied into the `./dist` folder.
